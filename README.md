# Advent-of-Code

Me solving the wonderful problems found here https://adventofcode.com/2021/events

I am attempting to solve these questions as quickly as possible (in prep for trying it competitively in 2021). Therefore I am not leaving many comments and am not always doing the most efficent solution. Granted some of the problems still require a bit of drawing things out and planning to solve xD (as I learned the hard way for day 7, 2020).

The way to access files should be straight foward. The 4 digit folders refer to the year, the numbered folders 1 through 25 in each year refer to the day.
